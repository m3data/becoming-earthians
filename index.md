    <p>What does it take for us to learn how to belong to Earth with intelligence, humility, and care?</p>
    <p>This site is a portal that explores how humans, technologies, and living systems cultivate adaptive capacity under planetary-scale stress.</p>
    <p>A central guiding question:</p>
    <blockquote>
      How can humanity cultivate adaptive capacity commensurate with the scale, speed, and entanglement of contemporary crises — without collapsing into uniformity, control, or fragmentation?
    </blockquote>
    <p>Humanity’s current adaptive mechanisms are mismatched with the scale and speed of contemporary crises, leading to systemic fatigue, entrainment pressures, and loss of diversity.</p>
