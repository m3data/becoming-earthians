## What this method is for

If cognition is relational, then sensing must attend to the coupling between individuals.

Relational sensing instruments:

- **Biosignal coupling** — how nervous systems entrain or maintain coherence
- **Semantic coupling** — how meaning shifts, reorganises, and stabilises through dialogue
- **Temporal dynamics** — how patterns of coupling change over time

## What it can tell us

Relational sensing can detect:

- **Entrainment** — phase-locking, synchronisation, convergence toward shared attractor
- **Coherence patterns** — breathing (healthy oscillation), locked (stuck), fragmented (chaotic)
- **Transitions** — when systems shift between regimes
- **Load distribution** — who is bearing disproportionate coupling cost

This provides a window into dynamics that are usually invisible — the relational substrate underlying visible behaviour.

## What it cannot tell us

Relational sensing cannot:

- Determine causality from correlation alone
- Access meaning (only its traces in signal)
- Replace first-person phenomenology

The instruments participate in the field they measure. Sensing is always situated, partial, and interpretive.

## Why it is appropriate for this inquiry

The coherence theorem has implications beyond the model: *real* collective systems should show the same dynamics. But we cannot run controlled experiments on real communities under stress.

Relational sensing provides a way to detect coherence patterns in living systems — to see whether the mechanisms identified in simulation appear in dialogue, in governance, in human-AI interaction.
