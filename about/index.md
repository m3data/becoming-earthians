summary: Who is the lead action researcher behind Becoming Earthians?
---

## Mathew Mytka {m³}

Cybernetic action researcher, and applied technology and data ethicist working at the intersection of collective intelligence, regenerative governance, and human-technology relationality.

This work emerges from a lineage of curiosity, care, and responsibility toward life in all its forms. It is grounded in the understanding that cognition emerges through relationship — between people, place, machines, ancestors, ecosystems, and the more-than-human world.

## Institutions and affiliations

Currently, I am an independent researcher and consultant pursuing a PhD. Current teaching affiliations at the University of Wollongong (Australia) as MBA Subject Coordinator and Lecturer in _Leading Business Transformation in the Age of AI_.

## Lineage and influences

This research work draws on tributaries from cybernetics, systems thinking, ecology, relational ontology, indigenous wisdom, and collective dynamics. I've been mapping the intellectual influences that have shaped my thinking and practice over time as a work in progress reflective exercise. You can explore the lineage graph to see some of the key thinkers and concepts that have informed this inquiry.
